**Don't save the sys-spec or statements as anything other than .docx**

  Communicating through random text documents is kinda weird but I like the
aesthetic.

Im going to be adding random stuff to the system specification as I go along.
The individual statements we'll coordinate and do later, probably after the new
year or something.

After doing some number crunching I think this modules courswork might be
impossible to fail.
  Hear me out:
              Task 1 = 15 %
              Task 2 = 20 %
              Task 3 = 65 % = 40 % Implementation
                              10 % Individual Statements
                              10 % System Specification
                              05 % Missing percentage (Internal Documentation?)

Meaning that even if you do rather crappy in task 3 and only get like half the
marks, so long as you've done the first two tasks and the documentation you can
quite easily achieve 60%.

Weird huh.
